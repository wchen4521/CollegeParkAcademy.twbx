# Abstract
The goal of this project is to support CPA in its endeavors to promote its school and its advanced curriculum. By presenting information in the form of a dashboard, this project seeks to facilitate improvements and increase appeal by allowing stakeholders to assess the performance of the organization for themselves. The client provided  with several datasets on their students which allowed me to find and analyze trends within the data which could be useful in accomplishing this goal.

# Scope
The scope of this project includes the general use of a data dashboard on the College Park Academy website. This data dashboard will serve as a core item capable of displaying various information about the overall performance of CPA students for marketing and reporting purposes. The phases of this project included analyzing the given dataset, formulating the ideal design requirements, creating the initial prototype, getting feedback and modifying the prototype accordingly, and finally the project handover and final deliverables. 

# Deliverables
The first and main deliverable of this project is the CPA Data Dashboard. This deliverable will be provided in two separate formats, the raw Tableau Workbook file and a Weebly website with an example implementation of the dashboard.

The dashboard consists of 4 separate “screens” showcasing a total of 5 data features that help to describe the performance of CPA. These are:
●	University Acceptances
●	Accelerated Course Enrollment
●	PARCC Scores (2015-2019)
●	MCAP Scores (2020-Present)
●	NWEA Scores

These data features encompass the most crucial aspects of a school that stakeholders use to assess their performance; Advanced Curriculum, Standardized Tests, and College Prospects. Through separate dashboards for each data feature, It can allow viewers to examine each feature in detail while refraining from bombarding them with information in one spot.
The overall design of the dashboard consists of traditional CPA colors (Dark Gray, Red, and Yellow) with a sidebar that provides the title of the dashboard along with a textual description of the information presented. The data visualizations themselves consist of mostly bar graphs with interactive navigation buttons allowing users to switch between different years, grades, or subjects to see the different statistics. There are textual labels along with clear numbers written above the bars allowing for easy perusal of specific data points.

The goal of this project is to support CPA in its endeavors to promote its school and its advanced curriculum. By presenting information in the form of a dashboard, this project will facilitate improvements and increase appeal by allowing stakeholders to assess the performance of the organization for themselves. With the selection of key aspects to focus on, I am able to provide a holistic view of the entire school while still being able to hone in on specific data points. This allows for the unique advantages of CPA to be highlighted as trends and patterns in the visualizations compare CPA to other public, private, or charter schools across the various data features.
